# Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The following application is called weather dashboard. It contains a form that allows users to input a city to retrieve weather data for current conditions and five-day forecast. Data is gathered from fetching from openweather API. The objective was to learn and understand how server-side APIs are used and to organize the data in a user-friendly way. The benefit of this challeneg is that the user is able to view the current and forecasted weather data to be able to plan ahead. Through much research, mistakes, & trial and error, the challenge taught how to call an API properly and be able to isolate specific data to present to the user. Another lesson learned was utilizing local storage to be able to create a search history list to be able to go back to submissions and regenerate the data.
